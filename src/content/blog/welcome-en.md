# Welcome to my site!
## Why is it like this?
Because Windows as an operating system died forever in my eyes after the release of Windows 10 - I switched to Linux (yes, unix-like operating systems).
And despite the fact that I used Windows for most of my childhood - starting with Windows 98, I decided to recreate them on my site.
That is, for the sake of nostalgia. And to test myself with such a task - to recreate operating system interfaces on the web.

## What functionality?
Perhaps most of the toolkit (not advanced) has been implemented - from a calculator to mini-games and wallpaper settings.
And in the end - I decided that this is a great place to showcase my demos and prototypes of various projects.
Including the fact that from my work in IT and not only - I make notes in the Wiki to share knowledge. And to refresh my memory.

## I don't see X function/program!?
If it's not in the start menu - all programs or when you try to open it - a typical Windows error appears.
This means it's planned that way - implementing absolutely everything is pointless, but if you actively use my site - you can write me a message and I'll add it if I want/can.
