# Installation and Initial Setup

Installing GLPI requires a web server such as Apache or Nginx, PHP, and a database like MySQL. Once the prerequisites are in place, download the GLPI archive, extract it, and follow the web-based installer.

After installation you can configure mail settings, add your first users, and enable optional plugins.
